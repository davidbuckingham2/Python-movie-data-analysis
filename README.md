# Movie Data Exploration with Python

This project is an in-depth exploration of a dataset containing information about movies. Using Python and various data analysis libraries, we've conducted data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis to uncover insights from the data.

## Skills Demonstrated

This project showcases various data analysis skills, including:

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: We started by addressing missing data in the dataset and making sure it's in a clean and usable form.

- **Data Visualization**: Utilizing Matplotlib and Seaborn, we created visual representations of the data, making it easier to understand patterns and trends.

- **Statistical Analysis**: We conducted univariate and bivariate analysis on both categorical and numerical variables to gain deeper insights into the dataset.

- **Handling Categorical Variables**: We explored and processed categorical variables, allowing us to better understand their impact on the data.

- **Descriptive Statistics**: We calculated key statistics for the 'CurrentApprovalAmount' variable and used them to better understand the dataset.

- **Handling Outliers**: Identifying and visualizing outliers is crucial in data analysis, and we've done just that in this project.

- **Pandas Dataframe Manipulation**: Extensive use of Pandas for manipulating and transforming data within the dataframe.


## Conclusion

This data exploration project showcases a range of data analysis and data visualization skills, providing insights into the characteristics of movies. The analysis also identified key factors contributing to the success of a movie, with votes and budget demonstrating the highest correlation. Additionally, it was determined that certain variables like company, movie name, and genre had no significant correlation with success.

This project serves as an excellent foundation for further analysis or modeling in the world of movie data.
